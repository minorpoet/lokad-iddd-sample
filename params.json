The project is auto-configured to use file storage by default,\r\nand cleans it on every start.\r\n\r\nYou should see something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCommand: Create customer-12 named 'Lokad' with Eur\r\n  customer-12 r0 Event: Customer Lokad created with Eur\r\n  customer-12 r0 Event: Added 'Welcome bonus' 15 EUR | Tx 1 => 15 EUR\r\n  Completed in 145 ms\r\nCommand: Rename customer-12 to 'Lokad SAS'\r\n  customer-12 r1 Event: Customer renamed from 'Lokad' to 'Lokad SAS'\r\n  Completed in 27 ms\r\nCommand: Charge 20 EUR - 'Forecasting'\r\n  customer-12 r2 Event: Charged 'Forecasting' 20 EUR | Tx 2 => -5 EUR\r\n  Completed in 16 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, you can dive into the code by starting with `Domain` folder in this solution.\r\nThere also is a `UnitTests` project, which contains unit tests for the domain\r\n(in form of Given-When-Then specifications)\r\n\r\nYou can also try plugging in other types of event stores. Each event store requires \r\nconnection string and will auto-create all required resources automatically.\r\n\r\n### Want More?\r\n\r\nIf you want more details, here's what you can do next:\r\n\r\n* Check out the [Domain Driven Design community](http://dddcommunity.org/)\r\n* Dive into [Lokad.CQRS Sample Project](http://lokad.github.com/lokad-cqrs/) (much more detailed and practical version of this sample)\r\n* Check out [CQRS/DDD Pocket Guide](http://cqrsguide.com/case-studies) and [case studies](http://cqrsguide.com/case-studies)\r\n* Follow [@VaughnVernon](https://twitter.com/#!/VaughnVernon).\r\n* Follow [@abdullin](https://twitter.com/#!/abdullin).\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask the contributors.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n* [Vaughn Vernon](http://vaughnvernon.co/), Book author and reviewer.\r\n* [Rinat Abdullin](http://abdullin.com), A+ES text and this sample project.
